# About Me
- Hi, I’m Anthony G. Carannante.
- I recently graduated from a Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania.
- I’m a Python-focused data analyst currently learning about technical data analysis, specifically with Machine Learning and Big Data strategies.
- With my engineering background, I am prepared to tackle new challenges head-on and able to learn new concepts on-the-fly.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding financial analysis, sports analytics, or scientific/experimental data analysis.
- My hobbies outside of work include golf, soccer (Go Red Devils!), and music.
- Open to converse about new opportunities, analytics, or any topic outside of programming!
